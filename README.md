## Problem Statement
### Are you a parent? If so, you definitely consider your children in every decision you make. Whether it be the food you eat, career you choose or even the time you wake up. Parent’s priority is always their children. So when unexpected things happen--medical emergency, funderals, job interviews, or even birthday celebrations. Before making any decision, the number one question parents ask themselves is “who’s going to watch my kid if I go?” A babysitter!
